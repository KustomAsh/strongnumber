# strongnumber
A C++ Program that inputs a number from the user and then prints whether the number is an angstrom number or not. 
An Angstrom number is a number whose digits when cubed and summed make the number itself. 
For example the number 153 = 13 + 53 + 33, and hence it is an Angstrom number. 
 
Program made on Visual Studio.
